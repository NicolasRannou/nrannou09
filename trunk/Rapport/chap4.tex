\section{Results}
%
Tests has been performed to show the utility of the work done. The results are presented below. The testings are comparaisons between the results obtained with the previous workflow and the new one. The results obtained will then be reviewed by a specialist to evaluate the previous and the new segmented datasets.

\subsection{Bias correction}
%
Here we get going with the intensities inhomogeinities correction.
%
\subsubsection{Testing process}
%
we create a mask.

On the top right box, the 3d mask is shown. On the lower left yellow slice, the biased volume is presented. In the lower right slice, the corrected volume is printed
