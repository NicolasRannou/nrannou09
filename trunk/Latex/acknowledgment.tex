First of all, I would like to thank Brian WANDELL who gave me the opportunity to realize this internship at the Stanford University and who has always been here to assist me in my work. I would also like to thank Pamela WIDRIN for her help on the administrative side, especially to obtain the visa.\\
\par
Of course, my thoughts also go to my team of work and specially Jorge PHILLIPS, Robert F. DOUGHERTY and Anthony SHERBONDY for allowing me to work on such an interesting project, for their assistance when I needed, their time to answer to my questions and their understanding about my bad control of English. I learned a lot with them on very different topics. Indeed, I have worked on the creation of a complete MRI images management system, which involved two main fields: the computer science and the medical imaging science. Moreover, working in a such prestigious place is a good way to discover the research's world and to have the possibility to assist to a lot of talks given by researchers from across the world.\\

Then, I would like to thank Eric STINDEL to have accepted to supervise this internship and Dominique MARATRAY for her assistance.\\

Finally, I would like to thank all the people working in the VISTA lab for their reception and their friendliness. Thanks to them, my time in the laboratory has been a real pleasure and they made me feel good by including me in the team very easily.
